# Project 5: Database Design - Airport Project
Challenge: Design a database for an airport system.

Context: In this project, I designed a database for managing airport operations, including flight schedules, passengers, and airport staff. The goal was to create a system that could efficiently manage flights, crew members, and passenger information.

Action: I created models for flights, passengers, crew, and terminals. The relationships between flights and passengers were important for tracking ticket bookings. Similarly, crew members were assigned to flights, so I designed a relational structure that maintained these associations.

Results: The most difficult part of the project was designing a flexible schema that could accommodate all the different scenarios of flight schedules, staff assignments, and passenger bookings. After several iterations, I was able to finalize the schema with a strong relational structure.

Reflection: This project helped me understand the complexity of designing relational databases for real-world applications. It also taught me the importance of flexibility when designing systems to handle dynamic real-world data.
